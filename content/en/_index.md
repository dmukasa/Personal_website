I'm a third year PhD Candidate at Caltech.My primary research focus is 
on making wearable devices to monitor individuals health and nutritional 
information. I do this by desigining complex sensors capable of detecting 
a diverse range of biomarkers. I use advanced computational methods including 
quantum chemistry, deep learning, and generative models to motivate and 
accelerate the design process of these devices and enhance their sensitivity
and selectivity.
