The design of sensors for varrying biomarkers is a long 
and complex process. The design proceess for just one 
sensor can often take months or years of optimzation to 
reach resonable sensitivities and selectivities. The 
sensitivity and selectivity of a biosensor become 
paramount in biofluids like sweat where biomarker 
concentration is low and diversity is high. In 
this paper we introduce QuantumDock, a computational 
framework capable of automating the design process 
biosensors with the capable of detecting any 
metabolite. We demonstrate the use of this process by 
designing the first Phenylalinine sensor for PKU 
diagnositics. Check out the paper here.
